# ü§ñ Machine Learning 

## Why Learn Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is the brain of most modern AI systems.  
It allows computers to **learn from data**, improve over time, and make smart predictions or decisions ‚Äî without being explicitly programmed.

If you want to work in AI, **you must understand ML**:  
üìä how to collect data  
üß† train models  
üìà evaluate them  
and ‚öôÔ∏è use them in real applications.
