# 📚 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## What is NLP?

NLP means teaching computers to understand **human language** 🗣️
It combines **linguistics** (language) and **computer science** (coding) to help machines read, write, and understand text like humans do.
NLP is everywhere in our daily lives!

It’s used in:
- Google Translate 🌍
- Chatbots 🤖
- Voice Assistants 🎙️
- Search engines 🔍
- Text summarization 📝
- Sentiment analysis 😄😢

---

## 1. Text Preprocessing

### You Should Know:
- Lowercasing  
- Removing punctuation  
- Removing numbers  
- Removing stop words (like: "the", "and", "is")

---

## 2. Tokenization

### You Should Know:
- Breaking text into **words** or **sentences**  
- Tools: `nltk.word_tokenize()` or `spacy`

**Example:**  
"Hello, how are you?" → ["Hello", ",", "how", "are", "you", "?"]

---

## 3. Stop Words Removal

### You Should Know:
- Common words that don’t add meaning  
- Ex: "is", "a", "the", "and"  
- Remove them to focus on important words

---

## 4. Stemming vs Lemmatization

### You Should Know:
- **Stemming:** Cutting the word  
  - "playing" → "play"  
- **Lemmatization:** Return base word with grammar  
  - "better" → "good"

---

## 5. Bag of Words & TF-IDF

### You Should Know:
- **Bag of Words:** Count words in sentences  
- **TF-IDF:** Give more value to unique words  
- Used to convert text to numbers for models

---

## 6. Word Embeddings

### You Should Know:
- Words are converted to vectors  
- Similar words = similar vectors  
- Tools:
  - Word2Vec  
  - GloVe  
  - FastText

**Example:**  
"king" - "man" + "woman" ≈ "queen" 👑

---

## 7. Language Models

### You Should Know:
- Predict next word  
- Types:
  - RNN  
  - LSTM  
  - Transformer (e.g., BERT, GPT)

---

## 8. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

### You Should Know:
- Find names, places, dates in text  
**Example:**  
"Ahmed lives in Cairo." → Ahmed = PERSON, Cairo = LOCATION

---

## 9. Sentiment Analysis

### You Should Know:
- Understand emotions from text  
- Positive, Negative, Neutral  
- Useful for reviews, tweets, feedback

---

## 10. NLP Libraries

### You Should Know:
- `NLTK`  
- `spaCy`  
- `Transformers` by HuggingFace  
- `TextBlob`  
- `Gensim`
