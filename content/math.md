# Mathematics for Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Why Mathematics?

Math is the secret language of Artificial Intelligence.  
It helps us teach computers how to "see", "think", and "learn".  
Every AI model ‚Äî from simple decision trees to deep neural networks ‚Äî is powered by math.  
So, if you understand the math, you understand how AI really works.

Let‚Äôs explore the most important areas of math for AI, and what you need to know in each one.
