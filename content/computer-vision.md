# 👁️ Computer Vision (CV)

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision = Teaching computers to **see and understand images** or **videos** 🎥👀

It's like giving eyes to machines!  
Used in:
- Face detection 😄  
- Object recognition 🏎️📦  
- Self-driving cars 🚗  
- Medical image analysis 🧠  
- Augmented reality (AR) 🎮  
- CCTV monitoring 🎥👮

3. **Object Classifier**: Train a model to classify different objects in images
4. **Autonomous Navigation**: Implement basic object avoidance using computer vision

## 🎯 Conclusion

Computer Vision helps machines "see" the world like humans!
Start with images from your own phone 📱 and work your way up to more complex applications.

By the end of this roadmap, you'll have a solid understanding of how to make computers interpret visual information and build practical applications using these skills.
