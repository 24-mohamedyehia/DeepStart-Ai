# üß† Deep Learning

## Why Learn Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that teaches **computers to learn from data** using **neural networks** ‚Äî just like how our brain works üß†.

It‚Äôs used in:
- Self-driving cars üöó  
- Face recognition üßë‚Äçüíª  
- Voice assistants (like Siri) üéôÔ∏è  
- Machine translation üåê  
- And much more!
