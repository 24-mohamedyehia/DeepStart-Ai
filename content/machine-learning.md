# 🧠 Machine Learning Fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning = Teaching computers to **learn patterns from data** and make **predictions** or **decisions** without being explicitly programmed 🤖

It's the foundation of modern AI!  
Used in:
- Recommendation systems 🛒  
- Fraud detection 💳  
- Medical diagnosis 🏥  
- Natural language processing 💬  
- Stock market prediction 📈  
- Autonomous vehicles 🚗
