# üß† Software Engineering Skills for AI

## Why Software Engineering Matters in AI?

Artificial Intelligence isn‚Äôt just about building models ‚Äî it‚Äôs also about writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code that works in real-world systems.

That‚Äôs where **Software Engineering (SE)** comes in.

To become a strong AI engineer, you need solid software skills that help you:
- Build real applications
- Work in teams
- Deploy and maintain AI systems

Let‚Äôs explore the most important SE skills every AI developer should master.
